**COMSYS**

This is the helpfile for the MU Communication system! This system allows players across the game to communicate with each other over various 'channels' of communication. The 'Public' and 'Newbie' channels that every new player enters upon joining the game for instance.

Two of the most accepted uses for the comsystem are to allow OOC communication, and to allow members of groups of players to communicate with each other over the distance of the game.
