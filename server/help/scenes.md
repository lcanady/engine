# Scene System

The scene system is used to create managed spaces to RP. Think of a scene as a snapshot of a place, but encapilated. All poses will be saved in a scene for processing of logs later, as well as asynchonious play.

## General Commands

- `+scene` List the current scene you're posing in.`

- `+scene/last [<number>]` Retrieve the last several poses/emotes from the scene.

## Admin Commands

- `+scene/set <option> = <value> (admin)` Change a scene setting.

**Scene/set Options**

- `admins = <name list>` give list of names or dbrefs or alias to give those players rights to 'admin' commands.
- `join = <flag expression>` Set the flags of who can view/join this scene.
